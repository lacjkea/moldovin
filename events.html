        <h3>Events</h3>
        <h1>Winetastic Experience</h1>
        <p> We host two kind of wine tasting events to get you closer to the fantastic Moldovan wine culture.
            But what both have in common is the informal setting of them, nothing to do with the traditional sit-down tastings. Our events invite to a more social interaction, not only between our wine experts and the attendees but also between the attendees themselves.</p>
